> 如果一听到一种与你相左的意见就发怒，这表明，你已经下意识地感觉到你那种看法没有充分理由。如果某个人硬要说二加二等于五，你只会感到怜悯而不是愤怒。—— 罗素《[如何避免愚蠢的见识](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_21448220)》 

>  If an opinion contrary to your own makes you angry, that is a sign that you are subconsciously aware of having no good reason for thinking as you do. If some one maintains that two and two are five, or that Iceland is on the equator, you feel pity rather than anger, unless you know so little of arithmetic or geography that his opinion shakes your own contrary conviction.
